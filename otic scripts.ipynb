The focus of the project is to find a way to securely authenticate data using facial recognition to enable users on devices like phones, laptops, and automated devices to access data without having to remember countless codes and pins. The research includes the use of supervised learning techniques such as Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) with datasets from Kaggle and crowd-sourced images of African and Nordic faces to classify skin tones better. Results are expected to provide a secure way for data authentication by the end of the semester (January 2022).\n"
